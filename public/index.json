Our method is comprised of completion network and two critics. The frame completion network is trained to fool the both the local and global critics, which requires completion network to conceal frame distortions with regard to overall consistency as well as in details. Specifically, mask attention convolution layer is proposed, which utilize not only the temporal information of the previous frame, but also the intact pixels of the current distorted frame to mask and re-normalize convolution features. Then, both qualitative and quantitative experiments validate the effectiveness and generality of our approach in advancing the error concealment on low resolution video.","tags":["Convolution","Decoding","Training","Propagation losses","Kernel","Gallium nitride","Network architecture"],"title":"Generative Adversarial Networks Based Error Concealment for Low Resolution Video","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)   Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  **Two**  Three   A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/media/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}   Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }   Questions?

The authors propose a multiple vector of locally aggregated descriptors (VLAD) encoding method with CNN features for image classification. To improve the VLAD coding methods performance, they explore the multiplicity of VLAD encoding with the extension of three encoding algorithms. Moreover, they equip the spatial pyramid patch (SPM) on VLAD encoding to add spatial information to CNN features. The addition of SPM, in particular, allows their proposed framework to yield better performance compared to the traditional method.","tags":["Encoding","Feature extraction","Image coding","Robustness","Computer architecture","Visualization","Information processing","Intelligent systems"],"title":"Multiple VLAD Encoding of CNNs for Image Classification","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Qing Li","Qiang Peng","Junzhou Chen","Chuan Yan"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1540126800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1540126800,"objectID":"9960bd201521598e3b75c6f52f047865","permalink":"https://nauhcnay.github.io/public/publication/elmcnn/","publishdate":"2018-10-21T13:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/public/publication/elmcnn/","section":"publication","summary":"We present a new image classification system by integrating color information and the extreme learning machine algorithm based on the localized soft-assignment coding classification framework.

Firstly, the information of CU depths in reference frames is used for lost slices. For each LCU in a lost slice, the LCUs surrounding to the co-located LCU are used to calculate summed CU-depth weight, which is used to determine the conceal order of each CU. Then, the co-located partition decision from the reference frame is adopted for PUs in each lost CU. The sequence of PUs to conceal is sorted based on the texture randomness index weight and the PU with the largest weight will be concealed next. Finally, the best estimated motion vector for the lost PU is selected for concealment. The experimental results show that our method achieves higher PSNR gains and has a better visual quality than the state-of-the-art methods.","tags":["Indexes","Encoding","Partitioning algorithms","Visualization","Video coding","Copper","Decoding"],"title":"A novel weighted boundary matching error concealment Schema for HEVC","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f26b5133c34eec1aa0a09390a36c2ade","permalink":"https://nauhcnay.github.io/public/admin/config.yml","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/public/admin/config.yml","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"wowchemycms"}]
