## About Me

I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at Stanford University, working with [Maneesh Agrawala](https://graphics.stanford.edu/~maneesh/) in the [Brown Institute for Media Innovation](https://brown.stanford.edu/). My research focuses on human vision, human-AI collaboration, and creative design. I obtained my Ph.D. from George Mason University, advised by [Yotam Gingold](https://cragl.cs.gmu.edu/), and my Bachelor's in Communication Technology from [Southwest Jiaotong University](https://en.swjtu.edu.cn/).

## Research Interests
- **Human Vision:** Visual perception, perceptual studies for graphics and design
- **Human-AI Collaboration:** AI-assisted creative tools, interactive systems for professionals
- **Creative Design:** Sketch processing, vector graphics, digital illustration
